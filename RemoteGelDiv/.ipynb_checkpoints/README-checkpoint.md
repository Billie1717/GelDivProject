# GelDivProject
This repository has all the code and instructions for a coarse-grained microtubule spindle model & motors, implemented in an MC script and in molecular dynamics using LAMMPS

## Folders explained

The folder /MC_model has instructions and code for the MC version of the model, which is implemented in an oblong-shaped box.

The folder /MD_modell has instructions and code for the MD version of the model, which is implemented both in an oblong-shaped box and as spindles within a cuboid simulation box and ellipsoid geometry.

Lastly, the foler /Data_and_Figures has plotting scripts for and data for the figures used in my thesis.
